# Ruby Chess
The final project for The Odin Project's Ruby Programming course, where we have to build a command line Chess game where two players can play against each other. Other than that The player should also be able to save the game and load it later to continue playing it. This chess that i have built has also an option to play against bot instead of player which is optional, though the bot only pick random legal moves.
